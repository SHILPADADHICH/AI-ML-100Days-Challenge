# Day 12(PART-3) – Visualization (AI/ML Challenge)

This README explains the **core visualization concepts** learned during Day 10 (A, B, and C) of the 100 Days of AI/ML Challenge.  
The focus was on understanding **why**, **when**, and **how** different plots are used in data analysis and machine learning.

---

## 📌 Why Visualization is Important in AI/ML

Visualization helps to:
- Understand data distribution before modeling
- Identify patterns, trends, and outliers
- Debug model performance
- Communicate results clearly to others

In machine learning, plots are used not only for exploration but also for **model evaluation and research reporting**.

## 📊 Types of Visualizations and Their Purpose

### 1. Line Plot
**What it shows:** Change over time or sequence  
**Used for:**  
- Accuracy vs Epoch  
- Loss vs Epoch  
- Time-series data  

---

### 2. Bar Chart
**What it shows:** Comparison between categories  
**Used for:**  
- Feature importance  
- Category-wise comparisons  

---

### 3. Histogram
**What it shows:** Data distribution  
**Used for:**  
- Checking skewness  
- Understanding spread of data  
- Detecting outliers  

---

### 4. Scatter Plot
**What it shows:** Relationship between two variables  
**Used for:**  
- Feature relationships  
- Detecting correlation patterns  

---

### 5. Box Plot
**What it shows:** Median, quartiles, and outliers  
**Used for:**  
- Comparing distributions  
- Identifying outliers  

---

### 6. Violin Plot
**What it shows:** Distribution + density  
**Used for:**  
- Advanced distribution comparison  
- When shape of data matters  

---

### 7. KDE Plot
**What it shows:** Smooth probability density  
**Used for:**  
- Understanding data concentration  
- Comparing multiple distributions  

---

### 8. Heatmap
**What it shows:** Values using color intensity  
**Used for:**  
- Correlation matrices  
- Confusion matrices  

**Important Note:**  
Correlation heatmaps work only with **numerical data**.

---

### 9. Pair Plot
**What it shows:** Pairwise relationships between features  
**Used for:**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Understanding feature interactions  

---

### 10. Regression Plot
**What it shows:** Relationship + best-fit line  
**Used for:**  
- Regression problems  
- Checking linear relationships  

---

## 🔬 Research-Oriented Plots (PART-3)

### Accuracy vs Epoch
- Shows how model performance improves during training
- Helps detect underfitting or overfitting

---

### Loss vs Epoch
- Shows reduction in training error
- Indicates model convergence and stability

---

### Confusion Matrix
- Displays true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives
- More informative than accuracy for classification tasks

---

### Feature Importance
- Shows which input features affect predictions the most
- Helps with model interpretability and feature selection

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- Visualization depends on **data type**
- Numerical and categorical data must be handled differently
- Correlation is meaningful only for numerical features
- Good plots require:
  - Clear labels
  - Proper titles
  - Correct plot selection
