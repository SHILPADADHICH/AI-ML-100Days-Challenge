# Day 14 – Jupyter Mastery 📓

## Objective
To master Jupyter Notebooks as a core research and experimentation tool by learning magic commands, building interactive widgets, following best practices, and creating reusable notebook templates.

---

## Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Lecture (1 hour)
**Topic:** Jupyter Notebooks & Magic Commands  
- Understand Jupyter Notebook workflow
- Difference between Code and Markdown cells
- Kernel, execution order, and outputs
- Learn commonly used magic commands:
  - %time, %timeit
  - %matplotlib inline
  - %load_ext autoreload
  - %autoreload 2
  - %%writefile
  - %%time

---

### 2. Coding (2 hours)
**Topic:** Interactive Notebook Widgets  
- Install and explore `ipywidgets`
- Implement:
  - Slider widgets
  - Dropdown menus
  - Buttons and text inputs
- Build small interactive functions using widgets
- Understand how widgets improve experimentation and visualization

---

### 3. Practice (1 hour)
**Topic:** Best Practices for Research Notebooks  
- Structure notebooks clearly:
  - Title & Objective
  - Imports & setup
  - Data loading
  - Experiments
  - Results & observations
- Use Markdown for explanations
- Avoid repeated execution issues
- Write clean, readable, and reproducible notebooks
- Use functions instead of repetitive code

---

### 4. Lab (1 hour)
**Task:** Reusable Notebook Template  
Create a reusable Jupyter Notebook template containing:
- Project information header
- Environment setup
- Configurable parameters
- Utility/helper functions
- Experimentation section
- Results & conclusions
- Next steps

Save as: `notebook_template.ipynb`

---

## Deliverables
- `jupyter_magic_commands.ipynb`
- `interactive_widgets.ipynb`
- `notebook_template.ipynb`
- `README.md` (summary of learnings)

---

## Key Takeaway
Jupyter is not just a learning tool — it is a powerful environment for real-world machine learning research, experimentation, and rapid prototyping.
