# Day 10 – Visualization (AI/ML Challenge)

## Objective
Build strong fundamentals in data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and practice recreating plots commonly used in research and ML projects.

---

## Schedule Breakdown
- Lecture: 1.5 hours  
- Coding Practice: 2.5 hours  
- Lab: 1 hour  
- Review: 30 minutes  

---

## Part 1: Lecture Tasks (1.5h)
### Topics to Study
1. Why visualization is important in AI/ML
2. Matplotlib basics
   - pyplot workflow
   - figure vs axes
   - labels, titles, legends
   - colors, markers, linestyles
3. Seaborn basics
   - seaborn vs matplotlib
   - datasets in seaborn
   - themes and styles
4. Choosing the right plot
   - Distribution
   - Comparison
   - Relationship
   - Composition

### Deliverable
- Short notes (bullet points) on each plot type and its use case

---

## Part 2: Coding Tasks – Create 15+ Plot Types (2.5h)

### Dataset
Use:
- Seaborn built-in datasets (`iris`, `tips`, `penguins`, `flights`)
OR  
- Any CSV dataset you already have

---

### Mandatory Plots (Implement All)

#### Matplotlib Plots
1. Line plot  
2. Multiple line plot  
3. Bar chart  
4. Horizontal bar chart  
5. Histogram  
6. Scatter plot  
7. Pie chart  
8. Area plot  

#### Seaborn Plots
9. Count plot  
10. Box plot  
11. Violin plot  
12. KDE plot  
13. Heatmap  
14. Pair plot  
15. Regression plot  

---

### Optional (Bonus Plots)
16. Strip plot  
17. Swarm plot  
18. Joint plot  
19. Facet grid  

---

### Coding Rules
- Add title, x-label, y-label to every plot
- Use legends where applicable
- Use different color palettes in Seaborn
- Save each plot as an image (`.png`)

---

## Part 3: Lab – Research Paper Plot Replication (1h)

### Task
Replicate **at least 3 plots** commonly seen in AI/ML research papers.

### Examples
1. Accuracy vs Epoch line graph  
2. Confusion matrix heatmap  
3. Feature importance bar chart  
4. Loss vs Epoch curve  

### Instructions
- Create dummy or synthetic data if real data is unavailable
- Match:
  - Axis labels
  - Grid style
  - Color scheme
  - Plot layout

### Deliverable
- Folder named `research_plots/`
- Each plot saved with a clear name

---

## Part 4: Review – Visualization Gallery (30 min)

### Tasks
1. Create folder structure:

2. In `README.md`, document:
- Plot name
- Library used
- Purpose of the plot (1–2 lines)

3. Review:
- Which plots are best for classification?
- Which plots are best for regression?
- Which plots help in EDA?

---

## Final Checklist
- [ ] 15+ plots completed  
- [ ] Titles, labels, legends added  
- [ ] Research plots replicated  
- [ ] Organized visualization gallery  
- [ ] README.md updated  

---

## Outcome
By the end of Day 10, you should:
- Confidently choose the right visualization for ML problems
- Be comfortable with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Understand plots used in research papers
- Have a reusable visualization gallery
