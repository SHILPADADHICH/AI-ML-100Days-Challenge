### Day 04 – Python Functions & Libraries
##  ✅ Updated Tasks for Today

Learned Python functions in depth

Understood function parameters and return values

Practiced default and keyword arguments

Explored functions as first-class objects

Learned Python decorators conceptually and practically

Practiced importing built-in libraries

Built multiple utility functions

Created a personal utility library

Documented key learnings

### 🧩 Utility Functions Practiced Today

Function to calculate mean of a list

Function to normalize numerical data

Function to check if a number is prime

Function to calculate accuracy between predictions

Function to count missing (None) values in data

### 🧪 Decorators Practiced

Created a basic decorator to add pre/post execution logic

Used decorators to:

Log function execution

Measure execution time

Understood how decorators wrap functions without modifying original code

### 📦 Libraries & Imports Used

math – mathematical operations

time – measuring execution time

Practiced:

```python
import module

from module import function

```
Aliasing using as

### 🛠️ Mini Lab – Personal Utility Library

Created a custom utils package

Organized reusable functions into modules

Imported custom functions across files

Followed clean folder structure used in real projects

Example use cases:

Data preprocessing

Mathematical helpers

Reusable ML utilities

### 🧠 Key Learnings

Functions help write clean, reusable, and scalable code

Python treats functions as objects

Decorators enhance functionality without changing original logic

Libraries save development time and prevent reinventing the wheel

Utility libraries are essential for professional AI/ML projects
